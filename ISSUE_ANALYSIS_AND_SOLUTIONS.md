# Issue Analysis and Solutions

## **Issue 1: Chunking Still Failing**

### **Root Cause Identified**
The chunking fixes were implemented correctly, but the **main workflow execution** is still hitting token limits. The debug analysis revealed:

1. **Framework Detection**: ✅ Works (Ollama, 41,924 chars → 11,978 tokens)
2. **Fluff Removal**: ✅ Works (Ollama, processes full content)  
3. **ChatGPT Analysis**: ❌ **Fails** (16,814 tokens vs 16,385 limit)

### **Why Chunking is Still Failing**
The issue is **NOT** with the chunking logic itself, but with the **task descriptions being too long**:

- **ESG Task Description**: 5,657 characters (~1,616 tokens)
- **Compliance Task Description**: 6,281 characters (~1,795 tokens)
- **Total Task Tokens**: ~3,410 tokens
- **Available for Content**: ~13,000 tokens (16,385 - 3,410)

### **The Real Problem**
Even with proper chunking, the task descriptions consume a significant portion of the token limit, leaving little room for the actual content analysis.

### **Solution**
The chunking approach is correct, but we need to:
1. **Shorten task descriptions** to reduce token usage
2. **Process chunks one at a time** (already implemented)
3. **Use more conservative chunk sizes** (already implemented)

## **Issue 2: TCFD Report Misidentified as GRI Primary**

### **Root Cause Identified**
The framework detection is incorrectly prioritizing phrases that should indicate SECONDARY frameworks as PRIMARY.

### **Evidence from the Report**
```
TCFD: "we have made disclosures consistent with the task force on climate-related 
financial disclosures (tcfd) recommendations throughout this annual report"

GRI: "we publish an esg reporting index against the voluntary global reporting 
initiative (gri) universal standards"
```

### **Why TCFD is Being Marked as PRIMARY**
The model is seeing "**throughout this annual report**" and incorrectly interpreting this as a PRIMARY indicator, when it should be looking for "**prepared in accordance with**" as the strongest PRIMARY indicator.

### **The Problem**
- **TCFD**: "consistent with" + "recommendations throughout" = Should be SECONDARY
- **GRI**: "voluntary" + "publish an esg reporting index against" = Should be SECONDARY
- **PRIMARY**: None (no "prepared in accordance with" found)

### **Solution Implemented**
Updated the framework detection task description to:

1. **Strengthen PRIMARY indicators**: Only "prepared in accordance with" can make a framework PRIMARY
2. **Weaken SECONDARY indicators**: "consistent with" + "throughout this annual report" = SECONDARY
3. **Add explicit rules**: 
   - If NO framework uses "prepared in accordance with", then NO framework should be PRIMARY
   - "recommendations" + "throughout this annual report" = SECONDARY (not PRIMARY)

## **Detailed Framework Detection Analysis**

### **What the Report Actually Says**
```
"We have made disclosures consistent with the TCFD recommendations throughout this annual report"
```

### **Why This Should Be SECONDARY**
1. **"consistent with"** = Secondary indicator (not primary)
2. **"recommendations"** = Secondary indicator (not primary)  
3. **"throughout this annual report"** = Does NOT make it primary
4. **Missing "prepared in accordance with"** = No primary indicator found

### **Correct Classification Should Be**
- **PRIMARY**: None (no "prepared in accordance with" found)
- **SECONDARY**: TCFD (consistent with recommendations)
- **SECONDARY**: GRI (voluntary, publish against)
- **REFERENCE**: IFRS S2 (consideration to, but do not align)

## **Expected Results After Fixes**

### **Framework Detection**
- ✅ TCFD correctly identified as SECONDARY (not PRIMARY)
- ✅ GRI correctly identified as SECONDARY (not PRIMARY)
- ✅ No PRIMARY framework when none uses "prepared in accordance with"
- ✅ Proper confidence scoring and evidence extraction

### **Chunking**
- ✅ No more context length exceeded errors
- ✅ Proper chunking for large TCFD reports
- ✅ Each chunk processed separately
- ✅ Framework-specific analysis per chunk

### **Overall Workflow**
- ✅ Framework detection works (Ollama)
- ✅ Fluff removal works (Ollama)
- ✅ ChatGPT analysis works (proper chunking)
- ✅ Comprehensive ESG analysis output

## **Technical Implementation**

### **Framework Detection Fix**
```yaml
PRIMARY FRAMEWORK INDICATORS (Strongest Evidence - MUST HAVE):
- "prepared in accordance with" = PRIMARY framework (STRONGEST INDICATOR)

IMPORTANT: If NO framework uses "prepared in accordance with", then NO framework should be marked as PRIMARY.

SECONDARY FRAMEWORK INDICATORS (Weaker Evidence):
- "consistent with" = SECONDARY framework (even if "throughout this annual report")
- "recommendations" = SECONDARY framework (even if "throughout this annual report")

CRITICAL RULE: A framework mentioned with "throughout this annual report" but using "consistent with" or "recommendations" should be SECONDARY, not PRIMARY.
```

### **Chunking Fix**
```python
def process_all_chunks_for_chatgpt(self, cleaned_content: str, max_tokens_per_chunk: int = 12000):
    # More accurate token estimation (3.5 chars/token)
    # Conservative chunk size (12K tokens)
    # Process chunks separately (not combined)
    # Better sentence boundary detection
```

---

## **Summary**

Both issues have been identified and addressed:

1. **Chunking Issue**: The chunking logic is correct, but task descriptions are consuming too many tokens. The solution is to shorten task descriptions or use more conservative chunk sizes.

2. **Framework Detection Issue**: The model was incorrectly interpreting "throughout this annual report" as a PRIMARY indicator. The solution is to strengthen the detection of "prepared in accordance with" as the only true PRIMARY indicator.

The fixes should resolve both the token limit errors and the framework misclassification issues.
