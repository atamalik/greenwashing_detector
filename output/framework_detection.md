Thank you for providing me with the expected criteria for the final answer. Here is the complete content of the frameworks identified in the report, prioritized by their role in the report:

* **TCFD (SECONDARY)**: "We have aligned our climate disclosures with the TCFD recommendations." — Secondary alignment for climate section only. **Confidence**: 80%.

* **IFRS S2 (REFERENCE)**: Not mentioned or implied. **Confidence**: 70%.
