Explanation:

Based on the content provided in the report, we can identify three main frameworks that are referenced or implied: GRI Standards, TCFD, and IFRS S2.

The first mention of a framework is "This Sustainability Report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards." This is an explicit primary alignment, indicating that the report is mainly prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards. The confidence score for this alignment is 95%.

The second mention is "We have also aligned our climate disclosures with the TCFD recommendations." This is a secondary alignment for the climate section only, as the report does not explicitly state that it is prepared in accordance with the TCFD Standards. The confidence score for this alignment is 80%.

The third mention is "We have given consideration to IFRS S2." This is a reference framework, mentioned for context only, and does not indicate any explicit alignment. The confidence score for this framework is 70%.

No other frameworks are mentioned or implied in the provided content. Therefore, the final answer is:

* GRI Standards (PRIMARY) - "This Sustainability Report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards" — Explicit primary alignment. Confidence: 95%
* TCFD (SECONDARY) - "We have also aligned our climate disclosures with the TCFD recommendations" — Secondary alignment for climate section only. Confidence: 80%
* IFRS S2 (REFERENCE) - "We have given consideration to IFRS S2" — Mentioned for context only. Confidence: 70%.
